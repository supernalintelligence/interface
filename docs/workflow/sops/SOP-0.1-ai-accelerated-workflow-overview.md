## Quick Reference

### Key Principles (16 Core Rules)

1. **Plan before code** (system → feature → component → implementation → code)
2. **Isolate chats strategically** (new context vs continuity)
3. **Approve architecture first** (names, types, structure before code)
4. **Audit before implement** (search for duplicates, verify location, check names)
5. **Use patterns consistently** (follow existing, don't reinvent)
6. **Validate with multiple perspectives** (second opinion for critical decisions)
7. **Verify systematically** (checklists for plans, code, research)
8. **Iterate and refine** (first output is draft, not final)
9. **Team approves, Person verifies** (humans make decisions, AI accelerates)
10. **Test automatically** (pre-commit, pre-push, CI/CD, E2E)
11. **Commit atomically** (one feature per commit, clear history)
12. **Merge safely** (use `sc git-smart merge`, never force push)
13. **Fast-track low-risk** (post-facto approval for speed)
14. **Document decisions** (ADRs for architecture, decision log for micro-decisions)
15. **Evaluate and learn** (post-implementation reviews, capture lessons)
16. **Control changes** (impact analysis, approval workflows, safe rollback)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Implementing before planning  
❌ Accepting first AI output without review  
❌ Skipping approval gates  
❌ Changing names/structure mid-implementation  
❌ Using AI for critical decisions without human approval  
❌ Working without clear requirements  
❌ Generating code that doesn't follow existing patterns  
❌ Creating duplicates of existing code (audit first!)  
❌ Creating in wrong location (verify structure first)  
❌ Name collisions (check for duplicates)  
❌ Bypassing git hooks (--no-verify) except emergencies  
❌ Committing untested code  
❌ Force pushing to main/master  
❌ Merging without CI checks passing  
❌ Making decisions without documenting them  
❌ Skipping post-implementation evaluation  
❌ Making breaking changes without impact analysis

### Success Metrics

**You're doing it right when**:

- ✅ AI saves time (not creates rework)
- ✅ Code follows existing patterns
- ✅ Plans are approved before implementation
- ✅ Team understands what AI generated

- ✅ Decisions are documented and traceable (ADRs, decision logs)
- ✅ Post-implementation reviews capture lessons learned
- ✅ Changes have clear impact analysis and rollback plans
- ✅ Naming is consistent (check Part 15!)
- ✅ Roles and responsibilities are clear (check Part 16!)
